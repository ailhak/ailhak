- 👋 Hi, I’m @ailhak
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code so I can work from home as I'm a SAHM.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning phython, java, and xml.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I have only just started learning to tread water and am of no help to anyone.
- 📫 How to reach me: Same name on discord.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first foray into coding has been creating aliases for Avrae (DnD Discord bot), which then evolved into learning some drac2 basics. Making the aliases and snippets and seeing how something I make can give me end results I want is when I realised that coding was something I wanted to persue. Also our family have 3 cats and they're adorable.
